# List of papers about protein language models (pLMs) and protein structure prediction (PSP) methods
We recently released a review of pLMs and PSP models, but the field changes fastly and there are so many new papers that needed to be recorded and categorized. Inspired by the previous work ([Machine-learning-for-proteins](https://github.com/yangkky/Machine-learning-for-proteins)), we build this repository to list related papers of pLMs and PSP methods.

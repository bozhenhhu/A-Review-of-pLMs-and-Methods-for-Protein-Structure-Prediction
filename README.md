# List of papers about protein structure prediction (PSP) and proterin representation learning methods
We recently released a review about PSP models: past, current, and future, but the field changes fastly and there are so many new papers that needed to be recorded and categorized. Inspired by the previous work ([Machine-learning-for-proteins](https://github.com/yangkky/Machine-learning-for-proteins)), we build this repository to list related papers of pLMs and PSP methods.
